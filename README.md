Reinforcement learning project

3 probems to solve which has small, medium and large dataset.

1.small is 10 x 10 grid world problem.

2.medium is mountain car problem with 50000 states.

3.large is unknown challenge and optimal policy had to be determined. Its with 312020 states for which action has to be determined.

All data uses same code of Q-Learning.
